# MTH4000
I have learnt a lot from studying Python Programming 
I have learnt how to create lists, use for loops and much more 
For example, I have learnt how to write code for The Collatz Conjecture
def f(x):
    if x%2!=0:
        return 3*x+1
    else:
        return x//2
print[f(n) for in range(1,21)]

I look forward into learning even more advanced skills and functions in the Python 
Programming course and hope to make some side projects using those skills and lesson in the future
